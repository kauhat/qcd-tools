# QCD tools

This project is intended to be a workspace containing a handful of quantum chromodynamics tools.

The tools are configured as [Nix](https://nixos.org/guides/install-nix.html) packages, so running `nix-shell` from this repo should build them.

_They have not been tested._

## Tools
- [openQ*D](https://gitlab.com/rcstar/openQxD)

## TODO
- openQ*D
    - Copy README files to output docs directory
